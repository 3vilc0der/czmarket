# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp

/public/assets/*
# this dir is created by paperclip.
/public/system/*
# paperclip files saved to this dir during testing but directory should be automatically deleted anyway.
